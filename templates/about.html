	<h3><p>Why we need this Monitoring System?</p></h3>
	<p>As we know, due to the impact of the epidemic, the University of Iowa has changed from
face-to-face classes to virtual classes by the spring of 2020. The impact of the epidemic has
profoundly affected the normal operation of the university. In the future of college life, we need a
COVID-19 monitoring system, which can easily know the physical conditions of students and
teachers, so as to ensure the safety of the people of the University of Iowa and the operation of
the school.
	</p>
	<h3><p>How does the Monitoring System work?</p></h3>
	<p>As a student or professor, all need to report their healthy condions information everyday. Those
		information include your HawkID, First_name, Last_name, your Temperature in C everyday, FeelingGood or not,
		NeedHelp or not, TodayClass information, whether you contact with sick people, and the report date.
		Our employee will monitor those information closely. For people who feeling not good, the
		system can quickly find out, so that we can have a plan at the first time. Under such
		circumstances, the safety of students and teachers can be guaranteed. If the school do not start
		this project and start school in the fall, the professors and studentsâ€™ physical condition cannot be
		checked, it is like we are walking in a dark room. Therefore, monitoring the COIV-19 project is
		very necessary and responsible.
